* net.c: a manual implementation of a convolution layer/softmax network with
  backpropagation. it reached >90% accuracy on a subset of the MNIST data, but
  doesn't converge on the full dataset yet.

  immediate goals:
    - add second convolution layer, compare performance to keras network
    - better understand parameter initialization and maybe implement batch normalization
    - switch to less tedious programming language

* keras: a notebook with a two layer convolutional net. can achieve 97%
    accuracy on the testing set, but doesn't seem to converge reliably.
